# DWP-Task
A take home task from the DWP where I built a locally hosted web page which retrieves data from an API (including Longitudes and Latitudes of users), uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance from each user from London and displays the data using Promises onto the web page.

To run, simply clone this project, open the src folder iin terminal and run 'npm start'. Then visit the locally hosted site at port 3000.

On the locally hosted page, the API calls' retrieved data shows the following:
